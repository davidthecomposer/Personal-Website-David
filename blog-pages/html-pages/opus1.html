                <div class="article-text">
                    <p>Starting a music blog always seemed like kind of a ridiculous assertion to me whenever I would
                        briefly consider it. I mean, I'm plenty full of myself and think that everything I say about
                        music is pure gold like any composer, but I don't want YOU to know that's how I think. But
                        recently I have thought more about it as a chance for me to explore new ideas and topics in a
                        slightly more rigid medium than my own studies, while being able to share parts of my musical
                        process and projects with anyone who might be interested.</p>
                    <p> A few things to just get started. I'm not sure how long the current blog design will be up. I'm
                        in the process of learning front -end development (more on that later) and while I'm incredibly
                        proud of every little victory on that journey, I am also painfully aware from my compositional
                        life that I will likely be embarrased that I ever thought my current work was worthy of public
                        consumption.</p>
                    <p>I want to highlight some of the details that I'm sure you recognized. First, the 5/3 time
                        signature at the top left has been an important part of my life. I first encountered this idea
                        (dubbed imaginary meter or rhythm in some circles) while studying the music of Thomas Ades.
                        While I have dabbled a little bit with this way of manipulating meter that is akin to metric
                        modulations I ultimately came to see it as more of a symbol of innovative ways of thinking of
                        old problems or constructs. It was a really impactful time in my musical life and so I like to
                        remind myself that there are always new and interesting possibilities for creative thinkers.</p>
                    <p>The second element is the opus number.This is kind of a personal joke of mine that is self
                        deprecating. When I first started writing music at around age 17, I had aspirations well above
                        my skill level. I saw that Beethoven, Brahms, and Bartok all had Opus numbers so I decided that
                        I needed to start putting them on my little piano compositions as well. I actually kept this up
                        until I entered university where I quickly realized that not only was I not understanding the
                        meaning of opus numbers, but I wouldn't want any of my early compositions to be tied to my name
                        in anything other than a private double-locked folder on my computer. </p>
