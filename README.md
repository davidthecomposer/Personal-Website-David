# David Campbell Websites

This is the source code for my three personal sites. The descriptions of the sites are below:

## [Developer Portfolio](https://www.developer.davidhalcampbell.com)

This is a collection of all the projects that I've built. They are organized on individual cards with icons of which technologies were used and a representative picture. The user can flip over the card to see a more detailed explanation, or click on the navigation button to see the live app in action. At the bottom of the page there are links to my other sites as well as mmy most recent blog posts titles that will link to those stories.

## [Music](https://www.music.davidhalcampbell.com)

This page hosts a reel of my music compositions in different genres. There are some accompanying sound files, score pdf's, and information about the music. I also have a news section and contact forms. At the very top there is a large Carousel that shows some pertinent news items or new pieces and links to those elements on the page.

## [Composing Code (My Tech Blog)](https://www.blog.davidhalcampbell.com)

This blog was built using React Router and houses tech related posts, tutorials, and (I hope) interesting stories about my development experience. There is also a comment system and sidebar navigation system. I plan on adding search functionality, and creating another music-related blog of similar design.
